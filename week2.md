## Introducing GitHub and Markdown: An Information Systems Perspective
Top 10 Engaging Questions for GitHub Response + Sharing (20+10 Min.)

### Q1：Data vs. Information in Your Bank App: 
> When you check your banking app, you see your current balance. What is the raw data that had to be collected and processed to generate that single piece of information (your balance)?
> 銀行餘額是如何從原始數據轉換成資訊的？請列出至少兩種原始數據。
####  **Information You See in Your Banking App:**

* **Current Balance** — For example, "$2,150.00"

This is **information**: it's meaningful, processed, and ready to help you make decisions (e.g., "Can I afford this purchase?").
####  **Raw Data Behind That Balance:**

To calculate and display that single piece of information, the banking system had to collect and process **raw data** like:

1. **Your Account Identifier**

   * e.g., Account number, user ID, etc.

2. **Transaction History**

   * All deposits, withdrawals, purchases, transfers, etc.
   * Example records:

     * `+ $500 paycheck on Sept 15`
     * `– $60 grocery store on Sept 20`
     * `+ $25 refund on Sept 22`
     * `– $30 subscription fee on Sept 25`

3. **Timestamps**

   * When each transaction occurred (date & time)

4. **Transaction Types**

   * Deposit, withdrawal, interest payment, bank fee, etc.

5. **Source/Destination Info**

   * Where money came from or went to (merchant, other accounts)

6. **Account Rules**

   * Any holds, overdraft protections, pending transactions, interest calculations

7. **Currency Type**

   * e.g., USD, EUR, etc.
   * 
####  How Raw Data Becomes Information:
The bank's system:
* Aggregates all your **transactions**
* Applies **rules** (e.g., pending transactions don’t count yet)
* Factors in **interest, fees, and currency**
* Then calculates your **current balance**

So the number you see is a **summary** or **interpretation** of all that underlying data.

####  Summary:

| **Raw Data**                                  | **Processed Info**        |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| List of all transactions & amounts            | →                         |
| Timestamps of each transaction                | →     **Current Balance** |
| Transaction types (deposit, withdrawal, etc.) | →                         |
| Account rules and pending transactions        | →                         |
